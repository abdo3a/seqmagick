phylip is the standard sequence format for phylogenetics.
We have a converter which goes to standard phylip.
The problem is that standard phylip cuts off the names at 8 chars or so, and wraps the seqs.
An alternate format is "extended" phylip, which has one sequence per line, and full length sequence names.
The format starts with a line that looks like

  num_seqs alignment_width

Then just has one sequence per line (look at example).

COG0001.auto1.fasta -- what we start with
COG0001.auto1.phy -- what we get using seqmagick
COG0001.auto1.phymlAln -- what we want (extended phylip)
fasta2phyml -- a CRAP perl script to make what we want by yours truly several years ago

We would like to have seqmagick do a conversion to and from extended phylip with the suffix .phyx

We'll probably push this up to biopython, so let's make it modular!
