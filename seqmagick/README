seqmagick README
================
seqmagick provides a command-line interface that exposes some of the 
functionality present in the fabulous Biopython package.  For more information

seqmagick was inspired by ImageMagick, allowing for easy conversion between 
different sequence file formats, and a number of helpful transformation 
options have been implemented.
